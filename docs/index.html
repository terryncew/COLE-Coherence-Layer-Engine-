Nice — you’ve got the hub page live. ✅

What you’re seeing now (just the raw repo names/paths) means the hub is listing your targets, but it’s not yet rendering <openline-card> because either:
	1.	The HTML doesn’t have the card loop (it only prints the repo names, not the card element).
	2.	Those repos don’t yet have docs/receipt.latest.json published on Pages.

Fix path (hub HTML)

Instead of showing plain text, you want something like:

<!doctype html><meta charset="utf-8">
<title>OpenLine Hub</title>
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/terryncew/openline-core@main/receipts-kit/openline-card.js"></script>

<h2>OpenLine Hub</h2>
<p>Live receipts aggregated from your repos:</p>

<div id="cards"></div>

<script>
const repos = [
  "COLE-Coherence-Layer-Engine-",
  "dynamic-sentience-maps",
  "terrynce-curve-emergence-tuner",
  "tuner-engine-or-ContentTuner"
];

const cards = document.getElementById("cards");

repos.forEach(r => {
  const url = `https://terryncew.github.io/${r}/receipt.latest.json`;
  const div = document.createElement("div");
  div.innerHTML = `<openline-card mode="compact" src="${url}"></openline-card>`;
  cards.appendChild(div);
});
</script>

Fix receipts (target repos)

Each repo you listed must have:

/docs/receipt.latest.json

And GitHub Pages turned on (main → /docs). Example URL you should be able to hit directly in the browser:

https://terryncew.github.io/COLE-Coherence-Layer-Engine-/receipt.latest.json

If that 404s, the hub can’t render the card.

⸻

⚡ So:
	•	Update your openline-hub/docs/index.html with the loop above.
	•	In each repo (COLE, DSM, tuner, curve), add a starter docs/receipt.latest.json (you can literally paste any valid JSON receipt for now).
	•	Then refresh the hub — the cards will show.

Want me to hand you a minimal receipt.latest.json you can paste into each repo’s docs/ so they show up immediately?
